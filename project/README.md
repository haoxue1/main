# Project

Teams of students will complete a final project that applies some ideas from the class. Teams can consist of at most **two** students. Here are some guidelines:

- Your project shall be hosted on github. If you are on a team, pick one member's account.
- Add a link to your project's github repository [here](https://github.com/iit-cs579/main/wiki/Project-Teams)
- Add a descriptive README.md at the root of your project.
- You may use off-the-shelf analysis tools in your work; no need to start from scratch.
- [Here](http://curtis.ml.cmu.edu/w/courses/index.php/Social_Media_Analysis_10-802_in_Fall_2012#Sample_Projects) are some projects from a CMU course that are good examples to help you come up with ideas.
- You **must** collect your own data for this project. You can get ideas of the types of data [here](https://github.com/aronwc/mlsm/wiki/Data).

The 200 points is broken down into:
- 10 points - **Proposal**: Is the proposal presentation clear, well-organized, and thorough?
  - Create a presentation containing 5 slides, following the outline below:
    - Title: A descriptive title for your project and the team members names and CWIDs.
    - Problem: What problem are you trying to solve or what question are you trying to answer?
    - Approach: How are you going to do this? (at a high level)
    - Data: What data are you going to collect? How much? What fields from each record will you use? How will you collect it? Will you manually label any data?
    - Timeline: List five things that you have to do to complete the project, and the date you expect each to be done.
  - Create a two minute video (screencast) that contains your presentation of the slides
    - You will turn in a single .mp4 file that is a video of your presentation slides with your voice over narration.
    - You are welcome to use any method to create this screen cast. Here are two that I have used:
    - Using QuickTime: http://www.abeautifulsite.net/recording-a-screencast-with-quicktime/
    - Using screencast-o-matic: http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/
    - Obviously, two minutes is not a lot of time. If you write out what you will say and revise it, you should be able to focus on the most important parts and state them concisely.
  - Create a directory in one team member's Github repository (e.g., http://github.com/iit-cs579/yourid-asg )
    - Name the directory project (lowercase)
    - Into this directory you will push the following:
      - proposal.mp4: Your video from above
      - proposal.pdf: A pdf version of your slides.
      - README.md: A markdown file listing the project title, team members, and CWIDs
-  40 points - **Presentation**: Is the presentation clear, well-organized, and thorough?
-  50 points - **Code**: Can I reproduce your results by running your code? Is the code well-written, debugged, and documented?
-  50 points - **Report**: Follow the similar format as the papers we read for class. Your report should be 5-6 pages, including all references and figures. Are the main algorithms, hypotheses, and assumptions clearly stated? Are the comparisons with related work sound? Sections include:
  - *Introduction*: What did you do and **why**? What are the research questions of your analysis? What is your hypothesis?
  - *Data*: What data did you collect and how?
  - *Methods*: What did you do with the data, precisely?
  - *Experiments*: These should answer your research questions and test your hypotheses.
  - *Related work*: How have others approached this problem? What makes your approach different?
  - *Conclusions and Future Work*: What should we have learned from reading your paper? What's left to do?
- 50 points - **Scientific rigor**: Are your claims supported by the experimental results? Have you attempted to rule out all other reasonable competing hypotheses? Are the experiments soundly developed and executed?
